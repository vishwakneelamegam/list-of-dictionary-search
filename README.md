# list-of-dictionary-search
used to search dictionary in list of dictionary(example - [{"fruit":"apple"},{"fruit":"grape"},{"fruit":"mango"}])
I have used binary search to search in list of dictionary.   Loops may consume time according to the length of the list, if it's high then search time increases.
for this problem i used binary search algorithm to search the dictionary in list.
